# Countries-Assestment

Frontend JavaScript Junior Assestment.

### About

During my participation in the business semester at [Atos](https://atos.net/es-mx/mexico), I engaged in a technical test evaluating my JavaScript knowledge. The test focused on interacting with a countries API to create an application presenting essential country information in a user-friendly manner.

The main goal was to consume the countries API and display key data such as official name, capital, region, language(s), and flag in an interactive table. The app allows sorting, pagination, and field filtering for a better user experience.

Notably, users can access more country information by clicking on rows, utilizing Wikipedia's API for comprehensive details in a pop-up modal.
